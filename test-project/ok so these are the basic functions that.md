ok so these are the basic functions that we do.

1. we have a custom node framework that abstracts all the various web concepts like REST, websocket, crontask and kubernetes. What this framework allows us to do is to code it once and then by changing the relevant information in the connection information then we can easily change the deployment target from a server to AWS, AZURE, GCP and other cloud vendors at the flick of a switch.
2. We have interfaced this framework with a UI that makes it easy to implement and manage these deployments. This UI is basically a low code no code solution which gives the user the ability to basically write anything that your average developer could make. This UI also offers shortcuts to templated presets and an app store in which a user can choose a template from all sorts of categories that would fit their needs and they can add it to their project with very little effort.
3. We have an app store where developers from all over the world can come to create categorized templates for i.e a facebook type social network where they can check on and off the functionality in each sub category which they would like to use. So if the user wanted all social aspects  of this website but the user also wanted to deploy an eCommerce site mixed together then the user could also choose to merge two templates together. 

There is also other categories within the store. There are very high level presets or there are presets that can be just applied to the entity level its self or presets for adding an AWS account type configuration to our account. etc. 
4. We will also have an up and coming UI builder which will look something like figma but we will be able to deploy to a server or cloud service and create the html code for them. We will also have a UI builder which the user will also be able to deploy a mobile phone application to their phone.
5. We will also have management tools that will allow companies to use our systems and then integrate each of the various departments of the software development life cycle into one platform. This will reduce the inter department miscommunication and therefore time to market. This suite of products is also designed to make it much easier for companies to manage their entire infrastructure and maintain most if not all of their departments in one place.
6. We will offer a set of service testing and penetration tools that will give you an overall sore of the level of security of your backend.

Market Information: 

Target market: 
1. Developers - The devs of the world are worried that we'll loose our jobs to AI so we want to attract the devs of the world to come into our platform to utelize their skill sets and create templates and content within our platform for others to purchase and deploy to their systems.
2. We will open up our services via our API to allow other devs to create UI's and services around what it is that we do. 
3. Our system uses a prompt based language which is very simple for AI to understand and use to converse with our API. This will allow other AI's to use our system to create websites and apps without having to understand and create working code from abstract concepts that only humans can understand atm.  

Problems we are solving: 
1. Ease of development
2. Reduce the skill levels needed for I.T companies to hire as we will take care of all the complex operations
3. Reduce the time needed to develop therefore reduce the time to market and overall cost 
4. Create a market place for developers to utelize their skills to create a passive income with tried and tested code
5. Supply tools and penetrtion testing tools that test all endpoints and services with industry standard toolsets and reduce the need for expensive I.T experts
6. Simplify the syntax and level of code needed to achieve a task by using our opensouce framework
7. Simplify front end coding by using our open source mobile cross platform languge which uses flutter
8. Creating a tool that will be very simple for AI to utelize and communicate with to generate code on a users behalf
